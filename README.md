Quotes Slackbot
===============


This project uses [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/) to generate (trashy) 
quotes and [GLIDE](https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im) to generate themed images, puts
them together and publishes them on a [Slack](https://www.slack.com) channel.



# Examples

*Generated image theme:* snow-covered peak

![Quote: Leave today better than you found it.](examples/example-output-1.png)


*Generated image theme:* New York City night

![Quote: Hope to the end.](examples/example-output-2.png)


*Generated image theme:* heart open

![Quote: The energy of the heart is the essence of life.](examples/example-output-4.png)


*Generated image theme:* sunset in summer

![Quote: Life isn't about finding yourself, it's about creating yourself.](examples/example-output-3.png)

# Idea

Meant as an ironic joke, my manager [@andhus](https://www.github.com/andhus) at [Movesta](https://www.movesta.se) 
started posting motivational quotes every Monday morning on Slack, and after a few weeks, our colleagues started expecting
them. Eventually he got sick of it, so I went on to automate both his 5 minutes of work,
but those of Instagram influencers aiming to inspire humanity.
